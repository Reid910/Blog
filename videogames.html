                    Unreal Engine 5 has been released recently and promises some stunning scenery.
                    Check out the original article and some of its pictures

                    I remember checking out Nanite and being blown away by the number of things it can render with solid FPS.
                    I think this might blow me away just as much or more when I check it out.

                    The real thing to look out for is the games that come out with these grapics.
                    I bet they are going to look amazing, run smooth, and have a massive landscape.
                    I tried making a massive map on one of my roblox games, but roblox has something called streaming mode.
                    Streaming mode works similarly to Nanite but its not nearly as effective and thats just half of this update for Unreal.
