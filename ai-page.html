                    Theres a cool article about AI that was posted in Dec 16, 2021.
                    Its about an AI that was invited to take part in a ethics debate.
                    I think what the AI said was very intresting because it says AIs will never be ethical.
                    Its reasoning was "AI will never be ethical. It is a tool, and like any tool, it is used for good and bad.
                    There is no such thing as a good AI, only good and bad humans."

                    Its very intresting that an AI is bound to be humans tool. I usually think of AI as a type of intelligence
                    and at one point the AI will hit a threshold to become the Terminator. It might be good and bad if AI is truly bound
                    to be another set of human tools.
